    <h1>Darian's World</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Welcome to my world, my name is Darian Rushworth, and I am pleased to meet you.
      Born and raised in <a href="https://alchetron.com/Table-View">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, moved over to the land of tulips and deep fried goods last year with my girlfriend.
       I have been working in the hospitality industry since I graduated highschool, I have been doing karate my whole life and it is a very big passion of mine, as for other hobbies: </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>sport</li>
        <li>videogames</li>
        <li>cooking</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In the land of wild beasts and a mountain shaped like a table, this is the fan favorite of the people, also known as: <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carling_Black_Label">zamalek</a>.
       If anyone would like to experience a proper South African braai, look no further than your very own braai guru Darian, PS: A braai is a BBQ but done right. 
       I am a fan of all kinds of arts and love the creativity artists have, the idea of having your creativity run wild is something that always excites me, 
      I cannot wait to dive into this course and enhance my knowledge, I am very new to computers but love every new challenge thrown at me.</p>
